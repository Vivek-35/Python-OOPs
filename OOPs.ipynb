        "# **Theory Questions**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "   - OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\" which\n",
        "     contain data and methods. It helps structure code for reuse, scalability, and clarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "   - A class is a user-defined blueprint for creating objects. It defines\n",
        "     attributes and behaviors (methods) that the objects will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "   - An object is an instance of a class. It holds actual data and can use\n",
        "     the class-defined methods to perform actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "   - Abstraction shows only essential features and hides the internal\n",
        "     logic. Encapsulation hides data using access control and wraps it with code.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "   - Dunder (double underscore) methods like __init__, __str__, etc., are\n",
        "     special methods used to define object behavior in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "   - Inheritance allows one class to use the properties and methods of\n",
        "     another. It supports code reusability and hierarchical relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "   - Polymorphism allows the same function or method name to work in\n",
        "     different ways depending on the object or class it’s used with.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "   - Encapsulation is done by defining private variables/methods using _\n",
        "     or __. Access is controlled through getter/setter methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "   - A constructor is a special method (__init__) that runs automatically\n",
        "     when a new object is created, used to initialize data.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "    - Class methods use @classmethod and take cls as a parameter to access\n",
        "      class-level data. Static methods use @staticmethod and don’t access class or instance data.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "    - Python doesn’t support traditional method overloading. Instead, you\n",
        "      can use default arguments or *args and **args to mimic it.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "    - Method overriding is when a subclass provides a specific\n",
        "      implementation of a method already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "    - The @property decorator lets you define getter methods that can be\n",
        "      accessed like attributes, enabling clean and safe data access.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "    - Polymorphism increases flexibility by allowing the same method to\n",
        "      behave differently for different object types, making code more reusable.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "    - An abstract class contains one or more abstract methods (defined\n",
        "      using @abstractmethod) and cannot be instantiated directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "    - OOP offers modularity, reusability, data hiding, and easier\n",
        "      maintenance by organizing code around real-world objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance\n",
        "     variable?\n",
        "    - A class variable is shared among all instances, while an instance\n",
        "      variable is unique to each object.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "    - Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one\n",
        "      parent class, combining their features.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n",
        "    - __str__ returns a readable string for users, while __repr__ gives a\n",
        "      developer-friendly string, often useful for debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "    - super() allows you to call methods from a parent class, especially\n",
        "      useful in method overriding and multiple inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "    - __del__ is a destructor method called when an object is deleted,\n",
        "      used to clean up resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in\n",
        "     Python?\n",
        "    - @staticmethod doesn’t access class or instance data.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - @classmethod takes cls and can access class variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "    - A child class can override parent methods, and when called, the\n",
        "      correct version (based on the object) is executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "    - Method chaining allows calling multiple methods in a single line by\n",
        "      returning self from each method.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "    - __call__ makes an object callable like a function. It defines what\n",
        "      happens when you use obj() syntax.\n",
        "\n"
